# High-Cloud-Airlines-Analysis-Aviation-Data-Analytics-Project
## 🔎 Project Summary
Developed a comprehensive **Aviation Data Analytics Dashboard** analyzing airline operations across the United States, with partial coverage of Latin America, Atlantic, and Pacific regions.
This project focuses on **passenger demand, payload capacity, market dominance, and revenue opportunities** using SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI.
The objective was to derive actionable insights for airline capacity planning, demand forecasting, and competitive market positioning.

## 🎯 Business Objective
* Analyze passenger demand trends (2008–2013)
* Evaluate airline market share & leading players
* Identify domestic vs international capacity utilization
* Study passenger travel behavior (distance & weekday/weekend trends)
* Discover revenue optimization opportunities

## Key KPIs Designed
* Total Passenger Demand
* Payload Capacity Utilization
* Domestic vs International Revenue Share
* Airline Market Share
* Distance-wise Passenger Distribution
* Weekend vs Weekday Travel Trend
* Revenue Opportunity Analysis

## Key Business Insights
* Passenger demand increased from **30M to 33M (2008–2013)**
* Payload capacity remained stable between **12–17 Billion**
* Domestic sector utilization reached **91% capacity**
* 55% passengers traveled distances under 500 miles
* Peak leisure traffic observed on weekends (Los Angeles & New York routes)
* Southwest, Delta & US Airways dominated US aviation market

## Strategic Recommendations
* Focus on short-distance competitive fare strategies
* Strengthen domestic route capacity for higher revenue generation
* Optimize weekend pricing for leisure destinations
* Develop differentiated service strategies for emerging competitors
* Enhance weekday business travel targeting
